# Spring Core Annotations Summary  

## 1. @Component  
Marks a Java class as a Spring-managed bean.  

### @Component annotation has the following sub-types:  

- **@RestController:** Used for RESTful web services (combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`).  
- **@Service:** Indicates a service layer component containing business logic.  
- **@Repository:** Marks a data access object (DAO) and provides exception translation.  

**Note:**  
If you‚Äôre creating a Java class in a Spring Boot project and none of the specialized annotations (`@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`) are suitable for the purpose of that class, you can use **@Component** to mark it as a Spring-managed bean.

### Example

```
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something...");
    }
}
```


## 2. @Configuration
Marks a class as a source of bean definitions. It is used when you want to manually configure and define beans, especially when integrating third-party libraries or code that Spring doesn‚Äôt automatically detect as a bean.  

### üîë Why Use @Configuration Instead of @Component:  
- Third-party libraries or external code cannot be annotated with **@Component** since you don‚Äôt have control over their source code.  
- To make such classes available as beans, you use **@Configuration** to explicitly declare beans using the **@Bean** annotation.  
- **@Bean** is a Spring annotation that registers a method's return value as a Spring-managed bean inside a @Configuration class.

### Usage:  
The **@Configuration** and **@Bean** annotations are used together to define and manage beans manually.  

**Example:**  
```
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
```

**Note:**
In Simple terms, a Bean is a Java class that is managed and recognized by the Spring IoC container. A normal Java class is not recognized by Spring on its own. We need to provide specific annotations (like @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Configuration) to make it a bean, and then Spring can recognize and manage it.


## 3. @Value
The `@Value` annotation injects values into fields from properties files, system environment variables, or default values.

### üîπ **Usage Examples**  

#### **Ô∏è Injecting from `application.properties`**  
**`application.properties`**  
```properties
app.name=Spring Boot Application
```
**Java Class**  
```java
@Value("${app.name}")
private String appName;
```
‚úÖ Injects `appName` with `Spring Boot Application`.

---

#### ** Setting Default Values**  
```java
@Value("${app.version:1.0}")
private String appVersion;
```
‚úÖ If `app.version` is missing, `appVersion` defaults to `1.0`.

---

#### ** Injecting System Environment Variables**  
```java
@Value("${JAVA_HOME}")
private String javaHome;
```
‚úÖ Injects system's `JAVA_HOME` path.

---

#### ** Using Spring Expression Language (SpEL)**  
```java
@Value("#{10 + 20}")
private int sum;
```
‚úÖ `sum` is assigned `30`.


## 4. @Autowired
The `@Autowired` annotation in Spring is used for **automatic dependency injection**. It tells Spring to resolve and inject the required bean **automatically**, reducing the need for manual object creation.  

### **üìå How it Works?**  
- When `@Autowired` is placed on a **field, constructor, or setter**, Spring looks for a matching bean and injects it.  
- It works with **Spring's IoC (Inversion of Control) container** to manage dependencies.  

### **üîπ Key Points:**  
‚úî `@Autowired` enables automatic dependency resolution.  
‚úî Works on **fields, constructors, and setter methods**.  
‚úî If multiple beans exist, use `@Qualifier` or `@Primary` to specify which bean to inject.  
‚úî **Constructor injection is preferred** as it ensures required dependencies and immutability.

---

## 5. @Qualifier
When multiple beans of the same type exist, Spring doesn‚Äôt know which one to inject. `@Qualifier` helps specify the exact bean to use.  

#### **üìå Example (Constructor Injection):**  
```java
@Component
class PetrolEngine implements Engine { }

@Component
class DieselEngine implements Engine { }

@Component
class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(@Qualifier("petrolEngine") Engine engine) {  // "petrolEngine" (first letter lowercase)
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
üîπ **Key Points:**  
- The bean name must match the class name with a lowercase first letter.
- `@Qualifier("petrolEngine")` tells Spring to inject `PetrolEngine` instead of `DieselEngine`.  

---

## 6. @Primary
If multiple beans exist and no `@Qualifier` is used, Spring injects the bean marked with `@Primary` by default.  

#### **üìå Example:**  
```java
@Component
@Primary  // Marks DieselEngine as the default bean
class DieselEngine implements Engine { }

@Component
class PetrolEngine implements Engine { }

@Component
class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {  // No @Qualifier used
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
üîπ **Key Points:**  
- `@Primary` removes the need for `@Qualifier` unless we want to override it.
- If both `@Primary` and `@Qualifier` are used, **`@Qualifier` takes precedence**.  

---

## 7. @Lazy
By default, Spring creates all beans at startup. `@Lazy` prevents this, delaying bean creation until it's actually needed.  

#### **üìå Example:**  
```java
@Component
@Lazy  // This bean will not be created at startup
class HeavyDatabaseConnection {
    public HeavyDatabaseConnection() {
        System.out.println("Database Connection Initialized!");
    }
}

@Component
class Application {
    private HeavyDatabaseConnection dbConnection;

    @Autowired
    public Application(HeavyDatabaseConnection dbConnection) {
        this.dbConnection = dbConnection;
    }
}
```
üîπ **Key Points:**  
- Without `@Lazy`, the `HeavyDatabaseConnection` instance is created at startup.
- With `@Lazy`, it is only created when `Application` accesses it for the first time.  

---

### **Summary:**  
- **`@Qualifier`** ‚Üí Specifies which bean to inject when multiple exist
- **`@Primary`** ‚Üí Sets a default bean, avoiding the need for `@Qualifier` everywhere.
- **`@Lazy`** ‚Üí Delays bean creation until it's actually needed.  

---

## **@PostConstruct & @PreDestroy Annotations**  

In Spring, `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotations are used for lifecycle callback methods, allowing developers to define custom initialization and cleanup logic for beans.  

## 8. @PostConstruct(Initialization Method)  
- Runs **after the bean is created and dependencies are injected**.  
- Used to perform setup operations (e.g., initializing resources).  
- It is invoked **only once**, after dependency injection.  

üìå **Example:**  
```java
@Component
public class MyBean {
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("Bean is initialized!");
    }
}
```
**Output when bean is created:**  
```
Bean is initialized!
```

## 9. @PreDestroy Cleanup Method)  
- Runs **just before the bean is destroyed**.  
- Used to release resources, close connections, etc.  
- It is **not invoked for prototype beans**, as Spring doesn‚Äôt manage their lifecycle fully.  

üìå **Example:**  
```java
@Component
public class MyBean {
    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        System.out.println("Bean is about to be destroyed!");
    }
}
```
**Output when application shuts down:**  
```
Bean is about to be destroyed!
```

### üîπ **Important Notes:**  
- These annotations work **only with Spring-managed beans**.  
- `@PostConstruct` runs **only once**, even for singleton beans.  
- `@PreDestroy` is ignored for **prototype beans** since Spring does not manage their complete lifecycle.  
- Alternative: Instead of these annotations, you can define lifecycle methods using `initMethod` and `destroyMethod` in `@Bean` annotation.  

üìå **Example using @Bean:**  
```java
@Bean(initMethod = "init", destroyMethod = "cleanup")
public MyBean myBean() {
    return new MyBean();
}
