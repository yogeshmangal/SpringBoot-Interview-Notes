# Spring Core Annotations Summary  

## 1. @Component  
Marks a Java class as a Spring-managed bean.  

### @Component annotation has the following sub-types:  

- **@RestController:** Used for RESTful web services (combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`).  
- **@Service:** Indicates a service layer component containing business logic.  
- **@Repository:** Marks a data access object (DAO) and provides exception translation.  

**Note:**  
If youâ€™re creating a Java class in a Spring Boot project and none of the specialized annotations (`@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`) are suitable for the purpose of that class, you can use **@Component** to mark it as a Spring-managed bean.
