# Spring Core Annotations Summary  

## 1. @Component  
Marks a Java class as a Spring-managed bean.  

### @Component annotation has the following sub-types:  

- **@RestController:** Used for RESTful web services (combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`).  
- **@Service:** Indicates a service layer component containing business logic.  
- **@Repository:** Marks a data access object (DAO) and provides exception translation.  

**Note:**  
If you‚Äôre creating a Java class in a Spring Boot project and none of the specialized annotations (`@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`) are suitable for the purpose of that class, you can use **@Component** to mark it as a Spring-managed bean.

### Example

```
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something...");
    }
}
```


## 2. @Configuration
Marks a class as a source of bean definitions. It is used when you want to manually configure and define beans, especially when integrating third-party libraries or code that Spring doesn‚Äôt automatically detect as a bean.  

### üîë Why Use @Configuration Instead of @Component:  
- Third-party libraries or external code cannot be annotated with **@Component** since you don‚Äôt have control over their source code.  
- To make such classes available as beans, you use **@Configuration** to explicitly declare beans using the **@Bean** annotation.  
- **@Bean** is a Spring annotation that registers a method's return value as a Spring-managed bean inside a @Configuration class.

### Usage:  
The **@Configuration** and **@Bean** annotations are used together to define and manage beans manually.  

**Example:**  
```
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
```

**Note:**
In Simple terms, a Bean is a Java class that is managed and recognized by the Spring IoC container. A normal Java class is not recognized by Spring on its own. We need to provide specific annotations (like @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Configuration) to make it a bean, and then Spring can recognize and manage it.


## 3. @Value
The `@Value` annotation injects values into fields from properties files, system environment variables, or default values.

### üîπ **Usage Examples**  

#### **Ô∏è Injecting from `application.properties`**  
**`application.properties`**  
```properties
app.name=Spring Boot Application
```
**Java Class**  
```java
@Value("${app.name}")
private String appName;
```
‚úÖ Injects `appName` with `Spring Boot Application`.

---

#### ** Setting Default Values**  
```java
@Value("${app.version:1.0}")
private String appVersion;
```
‚úÖ If `app.version` is missing, `appVersion` defaults to `1.0`.

---

#### ** Injecting System Environment Variables**  
```java
@Value("${JAVA_HOME}")
private String javaHome;
```
‚úÖ Injects system's `JAVA_HOME` path.

---

#### ** Using Spring Expression Language (SpEL)**  
```java
@Value("#{10 + 20}")
private int sum;
```
‚úÖ `sum` is assigned `30`.


## 4. @Autowired
The `@Autowired` annotation in Spring is used for **automatic dependency injection**. It tells Spring to resolve and inject the required bean **automatically**, reducing the need for manual object creation.  

### **üìå How it Works?**  
- When `@Autowired` is placed on a **field, constructor, or setter**, Spring looks for a matching bean and injects it.  
- It works with **Spring's IoC (Inversion of Control) container** to manage dependencies.  

### **üîπ Key Points:**  
‚úî `@Autowired` enables automatic dependency resolution.  
‚úî Works on **fields, constructors, and setter methods**.  
‚úî If multiple beans exist, use `@Qualifier` or `@Primary` to specify which bean to inject.  
‚úî **Constructor injection is preferred** as it ensures required dependencies and immutability.
