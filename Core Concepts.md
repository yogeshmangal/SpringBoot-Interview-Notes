# **Spring Boot Core Concepts: Tomcat vs Netty, Reactive Programming, Sync/Async, Thread Pool, and Event Loop**

## ** 1. Synchronous vs Asynchronous**
- **Synchronous** â†’ Tasks execute **one after another** (blocking).
- **Asynchronous** â†’ Tasks **donâ€™t wait** for completion; they execute **independently** (non-blocking).

---

## ** 2. Reactive Programming**  
- A **type of asynchronous programming** where components **react** when data is available.
- Used in **Spring WebFlux** (non-blocking, high-performance apps).
- Enables handling **millions of concurrent requests efficiently.**

---

## ** 3. Thread Pool Model (Tomcat) vs Event Loop Model (Netty)**  

### **ðŸ”¹ Tomcat (Thread Pool Model)**
âœ… Uses **a pool of threads**, where:  
   - **One request = One thread**  
   - If requests exceed available threads â†’ they **wait (blocking)**.  
âœ… Works well for **synchronous & traditional REST APIs**.  
âœ… Used in **Spring MVC** (blocking architecture).  

### **ðŸ”¹ Netty (Event Loop Model)**
âœ… Uses **a few threads** where:  
   - **One thread handles multiple requests** asynchronously.  
   - Uses an **event loop** to process non-blocking requests.  
âœ… Provides **high performance** and is great for real-time, scalable applications.  
âœ… Used in **Spring WebFlux** (non-blocking architecture).  

---

## ** 4. Event Loop Model (Netty, Node.js)**
- A single thread **registers** multiple tasks and processes them asynchronously.
- **No thread blocking** â†’ Thread remains free to handle other requests.
- Ideal for **handling thousands/millions of concurrent requests**.

## **ðŸš€ Key Takeaways**  
| Feature          | Tomcat (Thread Pool) | Netty (Event Loop) |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Concurrency Model** | One request = One thread | One thread handles multiple requests |
| **Blocking/Non-blocking** | **Blocking** (Synchronous) | **Non-blocking** (Asynchronous) |
| **Performance** | Slower for high loads | Efficient for massive loads |
| **Use Case** | Traditional REST APIs (Spring MVC) | Real-time, high-performance apps (Spring WebFlux) |
| **Spring Boot Starter** | spring-boot-starter-web | spring-boot-starter-webflux |
